<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every scribe that is instructed unto the
kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matt</span>. xiii. 52.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Scribes were the guardians of
the law, and its readers and expounders to the people.&nbsp; It
is related of Ezra, that he was &ldquo;a ready scribe in the law
of Moses which the Lord God of Israel had given: he had prepared
his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach
in Israel statutes and judgments.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in exercising
this guardianship the Scribes were only representing the Church
of which they were members.&nbsp; They were a class of persons
told off for especial attention to this duty, which in fact
belonged to the whole community.&nbsp; To the Jews as a people,
the Apostle tells us, were committed the oracles of God: and the
Church in all <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>times is the witness and keeper of Holy Writ, as of a
sacred deposit committed to her.&nbsp; The character assigned in
the text to the Scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven,
belongs, in all its particulars, to her, who both is the sum, and
constitutes the ideal, of all such guardians and expounders.</p>
<p>With these few preliminary remarks, we may apply our
Lord&rsquo;s words immediately to ourselves.&nbsp; The Christian
Church throughout the world is now the guardian of the Holy
Scriptures.&nbsp; All that the Jews had, we have, with the
inestimably precious addition of the New Testament of our Lord
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; These Scriptures all Christians regard as the
revelation of God to man.&nbsp; Other works rise and are built up
from below: this alone we receive as let down upon us from
above.&nbsp; All art, all science, all theology, which is but a
system built up by inferences from Scripture, these are of man,
and constructed on earth.&nbsp; They may rise higher, and become
truer, as one race is advanced in skill or in knowledge; but they
began below, and will ever carry with them the infirmity of all
that is born on earth.&nbsp; Whereas the sayings and the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>lessons of this
book are not of man, nor did they take their beginnings
here.&nbsp; They have come to us indeed through human words, and
by means of human action; but they did not arise originally in
the breasts of men; they came from Him who is Himself the first
spring of morals and the highest fountain of truth.&nbsp; Between
philosophy reared up from below, and the facts, and rules, and
motives, which they disclose, there is always a gap which our
reason cannot bridge over.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s sovereignty,
man&rsquo;s free will&mdash;God&rsquo;s creative agency,
man&rsquo;s inductions of science&mdash;God&rsquo;s interference
with physical order, man&rsquo;s establishment of physical
law&mdash;one member of each of these pairs will ever remain
discontinuous from, and in the estimate of human reason
irreconcileable with, the other.&nbsp; And because this Book is
unlike all other books, because its voice comes to us from
another place, and is heard in deeper and more secret chambers of
our being than all other voices, because its sayings have for our
humanity a searching and conserving and healing power which none
other possess, therefore it is that to keep these Holy Scriptures
in all their integrity as delivered down to her is the solemn <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>trust of the
Church throughout the world: a trust simple, direct,
indefeasible.</p>
<p>Now when I say the Church throughout the world, and in all I
shall say in these or like terms to-night, I am using the words
in their very widest sense.&nbsp; I mean by the Church no less
than our Article defines it to be, &ldquo;the great congregation
of faithful men in which the pure Word of God is preached, and
the Sacraments are duly administered according to Christ&rsquo;s
ordinance.&rdquo;&nbsp; I mean the whole body, wherever dwelling,
however ordered and denominated, who take the Scriptures for
their rule of life and for their ultimate appeal.&nbsp; On the
whole of this body rests this trust, to preserve the purity and
integrity of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Now of course this duty concerns primarily the Scripture in
the form in which it was given to man: the one sacred text,
existing for us at this day in the very language in which it was
originally written.&nbsp; In plain words, by way of illustration:
if the universal Church were at this day commanded to lay up a
copy of this deposit, as the Law was laid up in the ark of the
Covenant, that one copy <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>would consist of the Old Testament in
Hebrew and the New Testament in Greek.</p>
<p>But now comes in a necessity for the exercise of judgment on
the part of the scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven: in
other words, on the part of the Church.&nbsp; When we speak of
these two sacred texts, we speak in fact of a store of
both.&nbsp; These texts have been transmitted by human
means.&nbsp; They exist for us in many forms, coincident in the
main, but varying more or less from one another, principally
through infirmities incident to transcription in ancient
times.&nbsp; The great mass of these variations concerns matters
of relatively small importance.&nbsp; In primitive Christian
times believers were too intensely employed about the great
interests of the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom, to be very careful
about the mere letter of the Scripture narrative.&nbsp; Whether
in one and the same phrase our Lord <i>went</i>, or <i>came</i>,
or <i>journeyed</i>,&mdash;whether He <i>said</i>, or
<i>answered</i>, or <i>spoke</i>, or <i>answered and said</i>,
was to them small matter: and thus we have these and hundreds of
such as these insignificant variations in the different ancient
manuscript copies of our New Testament.&nbsp; But there are, and
in no small <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>number, other variations affecting the
sense,&mdash;modifying the facts of the history, diverting the
course of argument, changing the tendency of exhortation.&nbsp;
And it is with regard to these that the Church, trusted as she is
with the Scriptures, is bound to bring things old out of her
treasures: to seek back for the most ancient and best attested of
the variations, and to hold that fast as the text, rejecting the
others: or, if none can be found whose evidence sufficiently
preponderates, to publish to all the fact that it is so.&nbsp;
Less than this will not be a faithful discharge of the trust:
cannot satisfy her feeling of reverence for God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Now before we can proceed to any application of what has
already been said, we must advance further in the duty of the
Church as the Guardian of Scripture.&nbsp; The Word of God was
not given to be laid up and hidden, but to go forth and to be
understood.&nbsp; That faith which is to save the nations, cometh
by hearing, and hearing cometh by the Word of God.&nbsp; But the
nations are not able to understand the Scriptures as they were
given.&nbsp; And therefore it was very early recognised as a duty
of each Church to provide the <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Scriptures for her members in their
own language: to bring out of her stores not only things
old,&mdash;the genuine and venerable text of the word, but also
things new,&mdash;the new garment or vehicle of that sacred text,
its expression in her vernacular language.&nbsp; And here let it
never be forgotten, that though we believe Scripture to be a
thing divine, a version, every version, of Scripture must of
necessity be a thing human; must be liable to imperfection and
error, and capable of correction and improvement.&nbsp; It is in
fact, after all, little more than a comment or speculation upon
Scripture.&nbsp; A few of the simplest considerations serve to
shew this.&nbsp; Take but these.&nbsp; In almost every sentence
where there is fervour of feeling, or precision of argument, or
graphic description, we are totally unable to give in the version
the living force of the original.&nbsp; We are obliged to enquire
what is the general sense of that which is vividly represented,
and to devise some English words which will as nearly as possible
convey it to the mind: and thus the power and charm are
lost.&nbsp; Again, where an original word may have two or more
meanings, giving to the sentence where <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>it occurs a corresponding variety of
applications to life or doctrine; in our rendering we are
obliged, because there is no corresponding word of ours alike
fertile in signification, to exclude all but one of these
senses.&nbsp; On the other hand, where the original employed some
word of but one perfectly plain sense, we are often constrained
to use a term in our tongue which, bearing an ambiguous meaning,
weakens that sense, or even obliterates it altogether.&nbsp; Any
one may see, from even these scanty hints, how difficult, how
unsatisfactory at the best, must be the discharge of this portion
of the trust: how utterly impossible it is that there should ever
be a perfect or final version of the Scriptures: how the Church,
the Scribe entrusted with the custody and provision of
God&rsquo;s word for the souls of her members, is bound to bring
out of her stores ever from age to age things new, fresh and more
accurate renderings of such phrases of Scripture as time and use
may prove to have been inaccurately represented.</p>
<p>And observe, before we pass on to the account of our own
situation in these respects, that this duty incumbent on the
Church is to be performed <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>quite irrespectively of any beauty or
aptness of outward form which such rendering may happen to
possess.&nbsp; An erroneous rendering of a Scripture phrase may
have been so well put into words, may carry a sound so terse and
epigrammatic, as to have sunk deep into the mind of a nation and
to have become one of its household sayings.&nbsp; But who would
accept the excuse of beauty or aptness in the case of anything
else wrongly come by?&nbsp; It is strange that in this case only
has any such argument been used and allowed.</p>
<p>Now we in this land possess a version of the Holy Scriptures
which may challenge comparison for faithfulness, for simplicity,
and for majesty, with any that the world has ever seen.&nbsp;
Perhaps its chief defect is that it admits of being too highly
praised.&nbsp; Its pure use of our native tongue, the exquisite
balance and music of its sentences, the stately march of its
periods, the hold on the memory taken by the very alliterations
and antitheses, which were the manner of writing when it was
made,&mdash;these and a hundred other charms which invest almost
every verse, make us love it even to excess.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>And
when we intensify all these claims to our affection by the fact
that it has been for centuries, and is now, the vehicle to this
great English race of all that is pure and holy and lovely and of
good report, the first lesson of infancy, the guide of mature
life, the comforter of sickness and death, we can hardly be
surprised that many, and some of the best among us, refuse to see
its faults, and are unable to contemplate with any content the
prospect of their being corrected.&nbsp; It is a spirit for which
we ought to be deeply thankful, this earnest and affectionate
cleaving to the English version of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>But good as it is, there is one thing better.&nbsp; And that
is, the humble reverence for God&rsquo;s word, rendering a man
willing to make any sacrifice for the sake, if it may be, of
nearer approach to His truth.&nbsp; And as the public mind has
lately been and now is stirred regarding this matter, I think it
may not be a wrong use of our time to-night, if I venture to
speak to you of that part of the subject which especially belongs
to the pulpit: avoiding details, and trying to remind you in our
own case of the need for thinking of the duty at this time, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and of our
own means of performing it; taking into account, by the way, the
principal objections urged against our putting it in hand.</p>
<p>The necessity of thinking of the duty at this time arises from
two causes, setting in contrast our own circumstances with those
under which our version was made: one relating to the things old,
the other to the things new.</p>
<p>When that version was made, rather when it was constructed and
amended out of former ones, the available sources whence the
sacred text was to be derived were very few indeed, and those for
the most part not of a high order.&nbsp; In almost every case
where the real text is matter of doubt, and has to be ascertained
by evidence, our translators had not that evidence before
them.&nbsp; By far the greater and more important part of it was
not brought to light in any trustworthy form till within the
memory of living men.&nbsp; Nay, one of its most ancient and
principal witnesses has been within the last few years discovered
and given to the Church.&nbsp; And the consequence is that,
setting aside all cases of indifferent or unimportant variations,
there is by this time an immense weight of responsibility
pressing <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>on the Church with regard to these varieties of reading:
a weight which it seems to me only those can be contented to rest
under, who are not aware of its magnitude.&nbsp; We, the Churches
of Christ in this land, are causing to be read to our people, to
take but a single very solemn instance, words respecting one of
the foundation doctrines of the faith which are demonstrably no
part of Scripture at all.&nbsp; And we of the Church of England
are doing worse: we are reading those words by special selection,
implying that they convey a proof of that doctrine, on the Sunday
set apart by its name.&nbsp; This is perhaps the most prominent
example: but there is no lack of others: we might quote instances
where the text found in our English Bibles, which passes current
with millions for the word of God, has but the very slenderest,
if any authority to rest upon, and where other words, which very
few of those millions ever heard of, really are, according to the
Church&rsquo;s own belief respecting Scripture, the message of
God to men.&nbsp; We might produce examples again, where the
evidence of the great authorities is so nearly balanced, that to
the end of time, if no more <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>witnesses are discovered, the
question never can be decided which of two or more is the true
reading.</p>
<p>Now there is no reason to think that there was any fault in
our translators as regards this matter.&nbsp; Where they in their
time knew of an important variation, they noted it in their
margin, or indicated it by the type of their text.&nbsp; But in
the great majority of cases, the fact was not, and could not be,
within their knowledge at all.&nbsp; Upon us in our own time has
it fallen to carry out their principles with the vastly extended
light which God has shed upon us.</p>
<p>But, it is asked, are we able to do this?&nbsp; As regards the
text of the New Testament, where these variations principally
occur, certainly we are.&nbsp; The whole ground has been of late
years thoroughly and repeatedly worked over, and the evidence is
well known.&nbsp; In many of the most important of varying
passages, the decision of biblical scholars would be shortly and
easily made, which reading to adopt or reject, or whether to take
the middle course of fairly representing the uncertainty.&nbsp;
The number of such important <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>variations is but limited; and in
most of them, the voice of ancient testimony is all one
way.&nbsp; So that it seems to me there would be no formidable
difficulty, as regards the things old, in setting right at this
time the unavoidable errors, and supplying what were the
necessary defects, of our English Bible.</p>
<p>We now come to the second of the reasons which seem to press
on the Church at this time the duty of reviewing her stewardship
of the Holy Scriptures; and that reason concerns the things
new&mdash;the form in which those Scriptures are represented in
the vernacular tongue.&nbsp; In the main, as has been already
said, we have in this respect nothing to regret, and but very
little that we should be compelled to change.&nbsp; The character
and spirit of our version are all that we can desire.&nbsp; But
it is utterly impossible for any one capable of judging to deny,
that it is disfigured by numerous blemishes, far too important to
be put by or condoned.&nbsp; The gravest of these are due to
manifest errors in rendering; errors, about which there could be
but one opinion among biblical scholars of all religious
views.&nbsp; Others have arisen from <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>principles adopted and avowed by the
translators themselves: as, for instance, from the unfortunate
one of allowing a number of apparently equivalent English words
an equal right to represent one and the same word in the
original, whereby very important passages have been disguised and
confused.&nbsp; Others again owe their source to causes which
have come into operation since the version was made.&nbsp;
Certain words have, as time has gone on, passed into new
meanings.&nbsp; Others, which could formerly be read without
offence, have now, by their very occurrence, become
stumbling-blocks, and tend to remove all solemnity, and even all
chance of fair audience, from the passages where they
occur.&nbsp; Some few blemishes may also be due (and it is hardly
possible altogether to put by this source) to doctrinal or
ecclesiastical bias on the part of the translator.&nbsp; Of the
various elements which were wisely united in the body of men
entrusted with the preparation of our version, one was much
weakened during the work by the death of two of its leading
members: and some apparently forced or inconsistent renderings
have been thought to be not altogether unconnected with this
circumstance.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>But,
after all, we are asked, of what character are these
blemishes.&nbsp; Do they, do any of them, affect points of
Christian doctrine?&nbsp; Now let it be observed, my brethren,
that this question is in itself a fallacious one.&nbsp; For what
is Christian doctrine?&nbsp; Is it a hard dry tabular statement
of dogmas, to be proved by a certain number of texts? or is it
the conviction of the great truths expressed by those dogmas
carried into the hearts and lives of men?&nbsp; If it be the
former, then might we, according to the objector&rsquo;s
argument, dispense with nine-tenths of Scripture
altogether.&nbsp; If the latter, then we can spare nothing which
may make it clearer or more forcible, better apprehended or more
warmly felt.&nbsp; I am persuaded that no one can estimate the
benefit which may be done to the souls of men by casting light on
any one saying of our Blessed Lord,&mdash;by making evident a
sentence before obscure in the writings of prophets or
apostles.&nbsp; And that this may be now done, done in very
important instances, done with easy consent and effectually, I am
also persuaded.&nbsp; The great principles of biblical
translation have in our time engaged many able men both here and
on the Continent; and to <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>most of the passages in which our
version has gone astray, our chosen revisers would come with
their minds firmly made up, and ready at once to apply the
remedy.&nbsp; With regard to some other blemishes which I
ventured to mention, its application would be easier still.&nbsp;
Few would fail to note, or be desirous to retain, an obsolete
word; and in the case of expressions of the other kind, the only
desire would be, while removing the offence, to leave unimpaired
God&rsquo;s testimony against sin, or whatever might be the
solemn sense of the passage.&nbsp; As regards the last class of
blemishes mentioned, those few which may be due to doctrinal or
ecclesiastical bias, the task might seem likely to be a hard
one.&nbsp; But I should be unwilling hastily to think this.&nbsp;
In many such instances, the question, as it would be raised among
our modern scholars, would never enter the region of opinion at
all.&nbsp; It would be simply one of faithful and consistent
rendering, to which the occurrence of the word elsewhere would
furnish an easy and safe guide.&nbsp; I trust it may be said of
the Church in our land, that the longer she lasts, the more she
becomes aware of the futility of forcing into the <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>sacred text
any foregone conclusions: the more she sees the importance of
keeping pure from all later alloy the water which men are to draw
from the wells of salvation.</p>
<p>We have thus advanced in our very hasty and incomplete sketch
of this subject, to the last branch of enquiry which we proposed:
by whom, and how, this review of the Church&rsquo;s stewardship
may be carried out.</p>
<p>In asking &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; we are in fact putting two
questions: under what sanction, and by what instruments.&nbsp; To
the former enquiry it might be answered, that inasmuch as
uniformity in the use of a Scripture text is of the first
importance, it would be desirable that the version when amended
should be put forth by authority.&nbsp; But there can be little
doubt that such an answer would be an inconsiderate one.&nbsp;
The procedure would defeat the very end it has in view.&nbsp; On
only one of the Christian bodies in this country would such
authority, even if complete in her sense, be binding.&nbsp; And
if the amended version were thus bound upon her, we should be
departing from the precedent set us in the case of our present
version, which, whatever <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>might be the intention of the notice
that it is &ldquo;appointed to be read in churches,&rdquo;
appears to have made its way to universal acceptance by its
intrinsic excellence, and without any binding authorisation at
all.&nbsp; There might be various conceivable ways of undertaking
the revision.&nbsp; It might be entrusted to a body of men
selected and commissioned by the highest power in the land.&nbsp;
Or the action might begin, as it is now beginning, with one of
the religious bodies among us, and might proceed, not confined to
that body alone, but extended so as to take in such of the rest
as might be willing to aid.&nbsp; But, however undertaken, the
result should be put forth to make its way simply and entirely on
its merits, and as approving itself to the conscience and
judgment of the Churches of Christ.&nbsp; And we are thus brought
to answer the second member of this enquiry, By what instruments
should the revision be carried out?&nbsp; Our last sentence has
anticipated the reply.&nbsp; Such a work should no more be done
by one section of the Christian Church than by one man.&nbsp; The
same concurrence and conflict of thought, the same variety of
experience, the same differing shades of <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>feeling and
apprehension, which render many men requisite for the work,
render also many Churches requisite.&nbsp; There is in the lay
mind a natural and well-founded distrust of men who are enlisted
in the warm advocacy of particular systems: and nothing but a
fair balance of the English Churches in the work would command
public confidence.</p>
<p>And then, how should the work be done?&nbsp; I do not mean, by
what kind of process or machinery: the necessarily arduous
details would be best judged of by those engaged in it: but I
mean, guided by what maxims, in accordance with what rules?&nbsp;
The task may fairly be compared to the mending and restoration of
a goodly piece of ancient mosaic-work.&nbsp; And such a
comparison may guide us to one leading rule which should dominate
the whole process.&nbsp; Nothing should be touched of the fair
fabric which can possibly remain: and all that is of necessity
new should be in strictest harmony with the old.&nbsp; So that
the ear, while of course missing from the altered sentence the
expression so long familiar, should find it superseded, not by a
startling modernism, but by words worthy to stand beside <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>those which
remain.&nbsp; Those who are acquainted with the history of our
present version will recognise in this rule the repetition of one
which its compilers had before them.</p>
<p>On this matter, I conceive there need be no alarm
whatever.&nbsp; Any body of English biblical scholars, with the
responsibility upon them of purifying our version, would be at
least as anxious to preserve its characteristic excellences as
any could be, who were not so deeply aware what those excellences
are.&nbsp; And let it be observed, that in this matter a version
for public and general use would of necessity differ from such as
may have been put forth for private benefit by individual
scholars.&nbsp; In those, it may have been desired to give to the
English bible-student some idea of the niceties and precise
constructions of the original.&nbsp; In the amended version,
there should be no such design, unless where our ordinary English
will fully and freely admit of it: no merely grammatical changes
of tense or inference, which might give awkwardness or stiffness
to what was before plainly and conventionally expressed.</p>
<p>From what has already been said, it will be clear <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that this
revision of the Church&rsquo;s stewardship cannot be brought
about merely by the insertion of marginal notices or
varieties.&nbsp; We all know how little chance the margin has of
being observed or known: and it would be a still more fatal
objection that, in the great majority of Bibles, the requisite of
cheapness precludes any marginal printing at all.&nbsp; There
might indeed with advantage be an addition of marginal notices in
matters of secondary importance: but all necessary substantial
revision must be made in the text itself, or it seems to me we
are exceeding and not fulfilling our duty.</p>
<p>There remains but one more consideration, without which we can
hardly dismiss our subject.&nbsp; Will not, it has been asked,
the varying of expressions in our version tend to disturb that
confidence and reliance with which its words are generally
regarded among English Christians?&nbsp; First I would observe
that this argument, as against the discharge of a solemn trust,
is worthless; and secondly, that I have no dread of the
consequence apprehended.&nbsp; The Church of England has used for
two centuries and a half, two distinct versions of the Psalms,
varying to a <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>degree but little appreciated,&mdash;and with no such
disturbing result.&nbsp; It is not a little remarkable, that a
precisely similar objection was raised at the time of the
undertaking of our present version,&mdash;but it was by the
Romanists.&nbsp; They complained of the unsettling effect of
these frequent changes, and of the marginal readings as leaving
men in doubt what was the truth of Scripture.&nbsp; With what
reason, let the firm hold which that amended version has kept be
witness.</p>
<p>And now in drawing to an end, let us ask ourselves, why it is
that the conscience of the Church is moved about this matter? why
it is that, a desire which not long since stirred only in a few
breasts, has now become ripe for practical settlement as to by
whom and how it is to be satisfied?</p>
<p>And the answer is to be sought in that conscience
itself.&nbsp; It brings to light the estimation in which this
Christian people have come to hold the precious deposit entrusted
to them.&nbsp; It is a result of the awakened enquiry, the honest
fearless research which have been and are being widely spent upon
every point connected with Holy Scripture: a <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>higher value
set, not in spite of but because of that inquiry and research, on
a treasure now no longer wrapped in the disguise of mere
conventional reverence, but opened and sparkling to every
eye.&nbsp; It is the old confession over again,&mdash;no longer
from the mouth of one standing in the prophetic front of his age,
but in the hearts of Churches walking in the fear of God and in
the comfort of the Holy Ghost,&mdash;&ldquo;Thy law is tried to
the uttermost: therefore thy servant loveth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this spirit, and in the depth of this affection, let us
contemplate the work which is proposed, let us undertake it if
undertaken it is to be: refusing to yield our reverence for
God&rsquo;s word to any overweening love for that to which we
have been accustomed, or to let go our present trust in His
guiding Spirit for any timid apprehensions of the peril of
change: but on the other hand doing nothing rashly, nothing
uncharitably; respecting the opinions of our brethren, and
dealing tenderly with their prejudices.</p>
<p>And let us who are anxious for this national work remember
above all things, that it is not by our professions of esteem for
God&rsquo;s word, but by <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>our proof of them, that distrust will
be removed and confidence inspired: by that word being seen to be
the source of our own motives, and the rule of our life.</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
